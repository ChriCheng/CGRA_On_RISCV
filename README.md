# Graduation-project
Design of master controller for Reconfigurable computing Architecture based on RISC-V
## Acknowledgments

This project is based on [RISC-V-CPU](https://github.com/jasonlin316/RISC-V-CPU) by [Yi-Chien Lin](https://github.com/jasonlin316). Which is a 32-bit 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU that supports basic instructions and some vector arithmetic.
